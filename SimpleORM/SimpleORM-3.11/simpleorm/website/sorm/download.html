<h1>SimpleORM/SimpleServlets Download Form&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo is required!"></h1>
<h2>Why a Download Form for an Open Source Project?</h2>
Because we like to know roughly&nbsp;who is
using SimpleORM, how they are using it and why they like or dislike it.
<p>By the time you have got here you will have read the <a href="whitepaper.html">whitepaper</a> and so have a fairly good idea
as to what SimpleORM proports to do. (If not, the we suggest that you
do so now.) Unlike many open source projects, we do not expect you to
have to download the tool just to figure out what problem it is
addressing.</p>
<p>So you should now have a fair idea of what you hope to gain from
SimpleORM. We would like to know your expectations, before you use
it. And we would like to have a way to contact people several months
after they download to see if they have actually used the tool and what
their experiences are.</p>
<p>Of course we are not in the business of spamming people, but we are
after basic feedback. So if you can spend a few moments filling out
the following form we would appreciate it. This is just a mail form
which is manually processed, this is all very low key.</p>
