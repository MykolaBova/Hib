<h1>Agile Java Web Development with SimpleWebApp<br>
</h1>
25 June 07, Anthony Berglas, Initial<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
SimpleWebApp lets you quickly develop high quality web
applications.&nbsp;
It provides reusable templates that encapsulate standard user
interaction
patterns that
list, view and update data (CRUD).&nbsp; SimpleWebApp also cuts through
the layers to integrate interfaces with databases.&nbsp; This means
that the only code you need to write is real application logic rather
than large quantities of repeditive glue code.&nbsp; And the code you
do write is plain old Java code because developing web application
should be ... simple.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
SimpleWebApp associates rich meta data with each field to specify
details
such as their display width, widget type, grouping and whether the
field must be non-null.&nbsp; This enables templates to be utilized for
a wide variety of forms without needing to alter the templates
themselves.&nbsp; The meta data can be
specified at the interface level or be defaulted from meta data
associated directly with database fields.&nbsp; Business rules can also
be incorporated at the
interface or database definition level.&nbsp; And the templates can be
selectively overriden to provide non-standard interfaces.<br>
<br>
This meta data driven approach enables customers to
extend a core application's interfaces, business rules, and persisted
data in external jars without any need to change the core
application itself.&nbsp; Traditional monolithic applications can then
be rearchitected as a core services with sepecific extension
packages.&nbsp; Applications can also be&nbsp; re-branded by providing
alternative template defintions that
can radically change their look and feel.&nbsp; Templates can also
automate
the provision of web services.<br>
<br>
SimpleWebApp uses very transparent Java code, with no code generators,
reflection, @annotations, EJBs etc.&nbsp; View templates are
implemented as
ordinary JSPs, and SimpleWebApp.jar is just 50K.&nbsp; Keeping it
simple
makes any problems easy to diagnose and so reduces the technical risk.<br>
<br>
SimpleWebApp's lightweight, highly productive design is analagous to
Ruby
on Rails.&nbsp; However SimpleWebApp's use of structured meta data is
more
suitable for the
more structured Java type system, and it enables a higher level of
abstraction
of common operations.&nbsp; JBoss Seam was inspired by Rails, but
unlike SimpleWebApp it uses psuedo POJOs to access heavy weight EJB,
JSF
and Hibernate technologies.&nbsp; (There is a more detailed comparison
in the Technical Overiview.)<br>
<h2>Example of&nbsp; "Automatic" Development<br>
</h2>
Consider the following screen which provides a tree view of Users
classifies by Role or Location.&nbsp; It then enables
selected users to be Created, Read, Updated or Deleted.<br>
<br>
<img alt="User Tree Screenshot" src="UserTree.PNG" height="841"
 width="833"><br>
<br>
A form like this would take substantial effort to implement
using conventional technologies.&nbsp; However SimpleWebApp's meta data
driven approach enables it to be created very succinctly by utilizing
abstract user interface and user interaction patterns.<br>
<br>
The following tiny fragment lists the code in <tt>usertreetest.jsp</tt>
that defines the page's view.&nbsp; The <tt>WPage</tt> tag links
the page to the <tt>WUserTreePage</tt> controller Java class which
provides the
meta data required by <tt>treecrud </tt>to render the page.&nbsp; <tt>treecrud.tag</tt>
is a
conventional JSTL template that uses nested JSTL templates to produce
the HTML for the tree and CRUD
components.&nbsp; The CRUD component can automatically render the form
because of the menu, field and button meta data provided by <tt>WUserTreePage</tt>.
<br>
<br>
<pre>   &lt;sw:page&gt;<br>       &lt;sw:<font color="blue">treecrud</font>/&gt;<br>    &lt;/sw:page&gt;<br></pre>
The form above is rendered using RSA's sophisticated ESG
template.&nbsp; But tiny
changes to the jsp can have it rendered in different templates to suit
different branding requirements.&nbsp; For example, the <a
 href="UserTreePlain.PNG">plain template</a> provides the same
interface using very simple HTML.<br>
<br>
The Java controller class required for this complex form is also tiny
as listed below.&nbsp; <tt>WUserTreePage </tt>consists of two
pagelets, <tt>WUserTreeCrudlet</tt>
and <tt>WUserTreePagelet</tt> that represent the left and right parts
of the page.&nbsp; <tt>WUserTreeCrudlet</tt> extends <tt>WGenericCrudPagelet
</tt>which produces a CRUD form for a specific table,
in this case the <tt>WUser</tt> table as specified in its
constructor.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<pre>public class <font color="green">WUserTreePage </font>extends WTestPage {<br>    WTestMenus.Database menus = setMenu(new WTestMenus.Database());<br><br>    public final WUserTreeCrudlet pagelet = new WUserTreeCrudlet(this);<br>    public final WUserTreePagelet treelet = new WUserTreePagelet(this);<br><br>    public static class <font
 color="green">WUserTreeCrudlet</font> extends <font color="blue">WGenericCrudPagelet</font> {<br>        <font
 color="#cc6600">//final WFieldInteger userId = addField(identityGroup, new WFieldInteger("userId")).setReadOnly(true);<br>        //final WField name = addField(crudGroup, new WFieldString("name")).setRequired(true); ...</font><br><br>        public WUserTreeCrudlet(WUserTreePage page) {<br>            super(page, <font
 color="blue">WUser.meta</font>);<br>            page.setRedirectItem(page.menus.userTreeTest);<br>            <font
 color="blue">generateCrudFields</font>();<br>    }   }<br><br>    public static class <font
 color="green">WUserTreePagelet </font>extends WTreePagelet {<br>        WTree tree = new WTree();<br>        @Override protected void onPreValidate() throws Exception {<br><br>            WTree.WTreeNode ur = tree.addNode(u, "By Role", "usertreetest.jsp");<br>            new WGenericTree().<font
 color="blue">addSubTree(tree, ur, WUser.meta, WUser.ROLE, WUser.NAME, WUser.USER_ID)</font>;<br><br>            WTree.WTreeNode ul = tree.addNode(u, "By Location", "usertreetest.jsp");<br>            new WGenericTree().<font
 color="blue">addSubTree(tree, ul, WUser.meta, WUser.LOCATION, WUser.NAME, WUser.USER_ID)</font>;<br>}  }   }<br></pre>
<tt><br>
generateCrudFields </tt>automatically creates meta data objects
for each column in <tt>WUser</tt>,&nbsp; which in turn causes them to
be displayed on the rendered form.&nbsp; The meta data can also be
created manually as illustrated by the commented out lines of code, as
discussed in the next section.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Likewise <tt>addSubTree </tt>knows how to
populate a subtree with data from a given table (<tt>WUser</tt>),
grouped by a specifed column (<tt>ROLE</tt>), displaying a specific
column (<tt>USER_ID</tt>) etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (All default behaviors
can be selectively overridden, as described in the next section.)<br>
<br>
The <tt>RSA_USER</tt> table itself is defined using meta data that is
created by the following SimpleORM code.&nbsp; It simply adds <tt>SFieldMeta
</tt>objects
such as <tt>USER_ID</tt> to an <tt>SRecordMeta </tt>object that
describes the table.&nbsp; Other meta information such as which columns
form part of the primary key and the width of string fields are
specified as additional parameters.&nbsp; This definition can be used
to generate the SQL <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements as well as
providing the meta data that <tt>WGenericCrudPagelet </tt>uses to
provide the actual controller logic.<br>
<br>
<pre>public class <font color="green">WUser</font> extends WRecordInstance  {<br><br>    public static final SRecordMeta meta =<br>        new SRecordMeta(WUser.class, "RSA_USER");<br><br>    public static final SFieldInteger <font
 color="blue">USER_ID</font> =<br>        <font color="blue">new SFieldInteger</font>(meta, "userId", SCon.SFD_PRIMARY_KEY,<br>                SCon.SGENERATED_KEY.pvalue(new SGeneratorSelectMax(meta)) );<br><br>    public static final SFieldString <font
 color="blue">NAME  </font>=<br>        new SFieldString(meta, "name", <font
 color="blue">40</font>, SCon.SFD_DESCRIPTIVE, SCon.SFD_MANDATORY);<br><br>    public static final SFieldString ROLE  =<br>        new SFieldString(meta, "role", 20, SCon.SFD_MANDATORY);<br><br>    public static final SFieldString LOCATION  =<br>        new SFieldString(meta, "location", 20, SCon.SFD_MANDATORY);<br><br>    static { setOptions(LOCATION, "Here", "There", "Somewhere", "Nowhere");}<br>    ...<br>    public @Override void <font
 color="blue">validateField</font>(SFieldMeta field, Object newValue) {<br>        if ( field == NAME &amp;&amp; newValue != null  ) {<br>            if (((String)newValue).length() &lt; 5 )<br>                throw new WValidationException("User.Name5Chars", null)<br>                        .setParameter(newValue+"");<br>}  }<br><br></pre>
Note that the code above specifies that the <tt>NAME</tt> be <tt>40</tt>
chars lonG and <tt>MANDATORY</tt> (not null).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is used
to create table columns appropriately.&nbsp; But it is also used to
make the <tt>NAME</tt> field on the user inteface 40 characters wide,
and to add a "<tt>*</tt>" to indicate to the user that the field is
required.&nbsp; It also adds a business rule to the UI code which
ensures <tt>NAME</tt> is not null.&nbsp; There is never any need to
respecify that information,
there is a single source of truth that works through all the layers.<br>
<br>
The <tt>validateField </tt>method is called whenever a <tt>WUser </tt>field
is changed and implements a (silly) business rule on the <tt>NAME </tt>field.&nbsp;
SimpleWebApp catches any <tt>WValidationExceptions </tt>and presents
internationalized messages to the user.&nbsp; (There are several ways
to implement validation methods, including as event objects or per
field (anonymous) subclasses. They can also be added to specific forms
rather than database record definitions.)<br>
<br>
(The WUser definition uses SimpleORM to access the database.&nbsp; It
is also possible to use other tools such as Hibernate, with methods
such as&nbsp; <tt>retrieveBeanProperties(row, getAllFields())</tt>
automatically utilizing POJOs.&nbsp; But SimpleORM is more transparent,
requires less ORM code,&nbsp; makes it easier to associate meta data
with table definitions, and facillitates externally defined
customizations.)<br>
<br>
The use of meta data enables a sophisticated form to be created with
very little code.&nbsp; This is implemented by very plain Java code
without the need for generators, XML, @annotations, complex build tasks
etc.<br>
<h2>More Manual Components<br>
</h2>
SimpleWebApp enables forms to be <i>selectively</i> customized at both
the view and controller level.&nbsp; For example, the following JSP
file defines a CRUD form with three fields explicitly named, namely <tt>id</tt>,
<tt>name </tt>and <tt>alignment</tt>. The <tt>id </tt>field has
been specified very manually in terms of raw HTML, but the <tt>name </tt>and
<tt>alignment </tt>fields have been specified more automatically by
referencing meta data.&nbsp; Likewise menus and buttons have been
specified completely automatically.<br>
<br>
<pre>  &lt;esgp:page-begin/&gt;<br>    &lt;esgp:heading&gt;<br>        &lt;esgp:menuAuto/&gt;<br>        &lt;esgp:body links="&amp;nbsp;"&gt;<br>            &lt;esgp:buttons/&gt;<br>            &lt;esgp:fieldBody&gt;<br>                 &lt;tr&gt;<br>                    &lt;td class=field_info&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;<br>                    &lt;td class=field_label&gt;&lt;fmt:message key="id"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>                     &lt;td class=field_req&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;<br>                     &lt;td class=field_input&gt;<br>                       &lt;input name="<em>id</em>&#8221; value="${fn:escapeXml(wPage.id.text)}"&gt;          <br>                     &lt;/td&gt;<br>                 &lt;/tr&gt;<br>                &lt;esgw:field name="<em>name</em>"/&gt;<br>                &lt;esgw:field name="<em>alignment</em>"/&gt;<br>            &lt;/esgp:fieldBody&gt;<br>            &lt;esgp:buttons/&gt;<br>        &lt;/esgp:body&gt;<br>    &lt;/esgp:heading&gt;<br>  &lt;esgp:page-end/&gt;<br><br></pre>
The templates themselves are just JSP .tag files, so it is also easy
for users to create or modify templates.&nbsp; (The templates are
broadly similar to Ruby on Rails templates, but have richer meta data.)<br>
<br>
The<em> <tt>WManualUserCrudPagelet</tt></em> controller below has also
been specified more manually.&nbsp; The three&nbsp; <tt>WField</tt>
objects <tt>userId, name </tt>and<tt> location</tt> have been
specified explicitly as final instance variables rather than having
been generated directly from a record definition using <tt>generateCrudFields</tt>.&nbsp;
Properties such as being required or the display length are explicitly
set.&nbsp; (There is no need to use this coding style, it is plain old
Java code.)<br>
<br>
Forms are normally posted back to themselves when the user presses a
submitting button.&nbsp; In this case validates and converts all of the
field values and if there were no errors it calls the <tt>onWasSubmitted
</tt>method.&nbsp; <tt>onWasSubmitted </tt>then explicitly updates
the user database record with the values of the form fields.&nbsp;
Likewise the buttons are explicitly declared and disabled as necessary.<br>
<br>
This processing is quite general and any form logic can be implemented,
inlcuding redirections to other pages.&nbsp; There is no need use a
database at all, and certainly not the SimpleORM interface shown
above.&nbsp; It is only classes in the separate <tt>SimpleWebApp.dbute</tt>
package such as <tt>WGenericCrudPagelet </tt>which link the
two.&nbsp; However, SimpleORM's ability to easily store and access
arbitrary meta attributes against fields and records makes it easy to
use and build tool such as <tt>WGenericCrudPagelet</tt>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
(Posting back to the same page simplifies error processing, and enables
form oriented view state to be maintained to implement optimistic
locking.&nbsp; A user can resubmit a
form if they make an error without losing field values .&nbsp; This
aspect is like ASP.NET but unlike Rails.)<br>
<br>
<pre>public static class <em>WManualUserCrudPagelet </em>extends WPagelet {<br>    WFieldGroup crudGroup = addGroup(this, new WFieldGroup("crud"));<br>    final WFieldInteger <font
 color="blue">userId </font>= addField(crudGroup, new WFieldInteger("userId")).setReadOnly(true);<br>    final WField <font
 color="blue">name </font>= addField(crudGroup, new WFieldString("name")).setRequired(true).setDisplayLength(40);<br>    final WField <font
 color="blue">location </font>= addField(crudGroup, new WFieldString("location"));<br><br>    public void <font
 color="blue">onWasSubmitted</font>() {...<br>        WUser user = (WUser) WUser.meta.findOrCreate(userId.getValue());<br>        user.setString(WUser.NAME, (String) name.getValue());<br>        user.setString(WUser.LOCATION, (String) location.getValue()); ...<br>    }<br><br>    public WButton update = addNewButton("Update"); ...<br>    @Overrideprotected void <font
 color="blue">onPreValidate</font>() {<br>        if ( userId.getText() == null ) {<br>            update.setDisabled(true); ...<br>    }   }<br>...<br><br></pre>
The astute reader may have noticed that the <tt>WUser</tt> definition
above does not actually contain the Custom Static and Custom Dynamic
fields that are displayed in the tree crud form above.&nbsp; They are
actually contained in a seprate class, <tt>WUserCustomize</tt>, which
could be packaged in a different jar provided by a different team of
programmers.&nbsp; The code itself simply creates additional <tt>SFieldMeta
</tt>objects, which may or may not have a corresponding final variable
to make them easy to access.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Business rules can also be added at this level, and fields and rules
could also be added to specific pages.<br>
<br>
<pre>public class <font color="blue">WUserCustomize </font>{<br>    public static final SFieldString <em>CUSTOM_STATIC</em>  =<br>        new SFieldString(WUser.meta, "customStatic", 20);<br>...<br>        for (String cf: customFields)<br>            new SFieldString(WUser.meta, cf, 20);<br>}<br></pre>
<br>
Finally, the same meta data that automates the implementation of user
interfaces can be used to automate computer interfaces, ie. web
services.&nbsp; Each field on a JSP page simply becomes an element in a
web service's XML.&nbsp; The service is accessed by simply changing the
URL from <tt>.../MyPage.swb</tt> to <tt>.../MyPage.xml</tt>.&nbsp; No
code is required.&nbsp; (Of course special case web services can also
be implemented, but SimpleWebApp automates the common case.)<br>
