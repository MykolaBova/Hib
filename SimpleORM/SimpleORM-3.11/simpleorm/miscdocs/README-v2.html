<h1>SimpleORM README</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="http://www.SimpleORM.org">SimpleORM</a> provides a very
simple and easy way to map relational tables into java classes. It
uses a novel generalized design to avoid the need for reflection and
numerous configuration files. SimpleORM takes care with database
semantics such as locking and caching, and also alows from raw JDBC
and non-Java database access.
<p>The <a href="whitepaper.html">SimpleORM White Paper</a> provides a
detailed description of how SimpleORM works. It is strongly
recomended that it be read before attempting to run SimpleORM.</p>
<p>This is a new project, but all of the core features work and have
been
tested. Several databases are supported, including PostgreSQL, MySQL,
HSQL, and Oracle. The documentation is good and there is a growing
set of examples.</p>
<p>Because it is simple, very few bugs have been reported, and reported
bugs have been fixed very quickly. The next release or two will be
stable, production ready.</p>
<p>As to simplicity, the .jar is currently just 68kb. The code is well
documented, and we have taken care with things like toString() and
exceptions. So if you do decide to use it seriously it should not be
hard to work with the source.</p>
<h2>Downloading</h2>
The current version can&nbsp; be obtained by browsing<br>
<a href="http://simpleorm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/simpleorm/">http://simpleorm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/simpleorm/</a><br>
or<br>
svn co
https://simpleorm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/simpleorm/trunk&nbsp;
Simpleorm<br>
<br>
Archives are at<br>
<a href="http://simpleorm.org/SrcArchive">http://simpleorm.org/SrcArchive</a><br>
Future versions will be branched under the subversion tree.<br>
<h2>Unpacking and Building</h2>
The distribution contains the entire source for SimpleORM under the
simpleorm folder. It is slightly unusual in that it combines java
package folders at the same level as documentation and build folders
-- we like broad shallow hierarchies rather than narrow deep ones. It
contains the following folders.
<p>
<table border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/</tt></td>
      <td>This contains all only the sources,
both java and others. other projects may add an extra level called <tt>src</tt>,
but we prefer to keep things simple.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/core</tt></td>
      <td>The core simpleorm classes
themselves. The are in package <tt>simpleorm.core</tt>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/properties</tt></td>
      <td>The simpleorm property classes that may be shared with a UI
layer in the future.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/examples</tt></td>
      <td>The test and demonstration classes.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/build&nbsp;</tt></td>
      <td>Build scripts.
SimpleORM is built with apache ant, see build.xml for details. This
does NOT contain the built <tt>.class</tt> files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/../built&nbsp;</tt></td>
      <td>Everything that is
built by simpleorm. The ant build script creates this folder and all
subfolders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/../lib&nbsp;</tt></td>
      <td><tt>.jar</tt> files to
add to the class path go here. In particular your JDBC driver. You
create this folder.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>simpleorm/webSite&nbsp;</tt></td>
      <td>This gets posted to the SimpleORM.org website. Includes the
white paper.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">simpleorm/extras/SimpleORMGenerate<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Generates SimpleORM definitions
from existing table DDL using JDBC.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>simpleorm/extras/<tt>EJB/&nbsp;</tt></td>
      <td>Demonstrates how to use simpleORM with EJBs.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Having unziped the distribution you may need to set up a
<tt>simpleorm.properties</tt> file in order to obtain a proper JDBC
connection. This is described in <tt>build.xml</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>ant</tt> will do a clean build, (re)create the tables, and run
the
test program which demonstrates most of SimpleORM's features. <tt>ant
api</tt> will make the documentation.</p>
<h2>The Examples</h2>
The examples package/directory contains examples and test cases based
on a simple schema involving Department/Employee/Payroll tables.
Start with ADemo, which is run as the default ant task (for the
time being). It demonstrates how to open a connection, and perform
DML on records.
<h2>Version History</h2>
<h3>Version 02.21</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed SConnection close bug (on secondary generator connections).</li>
  <li>Make SQuery handle mixed case Columns properly (ie. call
SDriver.quoteColumn)<br>
  </li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 02.20</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added SDataSource object.&nbsp; Needed to be able to create
secondary connections for some key generators (see JavaDocs).&nbsp;
(Does not require a real javax..DataSource.)&nbsp; The
mainSConnection.attach method has been depricated, just use the
SDataSource object instead. <br>
  </li>
  <li>find, mustFind and create convenience methods added.</li>
  <li>Martin's validate record bug fixed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>SValidateField called for primary keys.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Uncopied MySQL Index code.</li>
  <li>Tidied code by breaking up some big classes, created static
SRecordUpdater and SRecordFinder.</li>
  <li>Split SConnectionEJB into classes, but it needs more work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 02.19</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added new SGenerator classes for generating record keys.&nbsp;
WARNING, slightly changed API for this, see GeneratedKeyTest.java.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Martins foreign key quoting fix and SQuery.getSFieldMeta.&nbsp;
Thanks.</li>
  <li>SQuery.in.needsConjunction fix.&nbsp; Removed deprecated JDBC
calls.&nbsp; Thanks Pierre.</li>
  <li>Convert spaces to tabs.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 02.18</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reorganized folder structure for IDE's such as Eclipse<br>
  </li>
  <li>Added Martin's boolean fix, plus extended SQuery equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 02.16</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SQuery combineBegin/End</li>
  <li>Martin's Boolean support.&nbsp; TF and YN.</li>
  <li>Dan's EJB Support.</li>
  <li>Dan's UNREPEATABLE_READ for MS SQL.</li>
  <li>New SDriver instance per connection, ability to easily set driver
parameters. (SConnection.getDriver().setMyFavouriteParam(...))<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 02.15</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stop SConstants from being a super type of SRecordInstance
etc.&nbsp; The reason is ease of use within IDE's, and compatibility
issues with
the J# version. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Incomaptibility Warning:- SRecordInstance etc. will no longer implement
SConstants, which will be renamed SCon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Code will have to
be changed
as follows<br>
<pre wrap="">  new SFieldString(meta, "EMPEE_ID", 20, SFD_PRIMARY_KEY); // Old<br>  new SFieldString(meta, "EMPEE_ID", 20, SCon.SFD_PRIMARY_KEY); // New</pre>
To keep the old behaviour just add SConstants to the extends list in
SRecordInstance.&nbsp; In Java 1.5 static imports could also be
used.
<ul>
  <li>Better communication between applications and the SDrivers with
more parameters to SPreparedStatements.&nbsp; (To avoid a brittle
structure with an ever growing number of parameters to
SPreparedStatement, the objects now created in two steps one to create
the object and set parameters.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Identifiers are quoted with "s.&nbsp; This avoids the problem
with all the reserved words in different databases.&nbsp; But it does
make them case sensitive."<br>
  </li>
  <li>SFieldMeta, SRecordMeta are now serializable for better
detachment.&nbsp; Care is taken to avoid duplicate objects.</li>
  <li>Can create new records while being detached.&nbsp; Can add keys
when reattaching.</li>
  <li>For detached records, correctly distinguishes references that are
null vs those that have not been fetched.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can
manually check using isReferenceAvailable.&nbsp; Also
getReferenceWhileDetached hook to try to fetch the record
remotely.&nbsp; And can nullReferences when sending them back to the
server.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Added many operators to SQuery, including Join, fieldOrder
By,.&nbsp; IsNull (references), Distinct?<br>
  </li>
  <li>More public methods.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Logging and toString improved, and bugs fixed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Simple Alter Table DDL generator.&nbsp; Allows you to create a
new SFieldMeta record at run time and then alter the underlying tables
to include the corresponding column.&nbsp; Enables end user
customizations.&nbsp; This would be very hard to do in other ORMS.</li>
  <li>BINARY SFieldObject?</li>
  <li>Added SRecordMeta.sFieldNames to redundantly store an ArrayList
of the names of the fields for debugging.</li>
  <li>Removed&nbsp; nextGeneratedValue from drivers with databases that
support sequences.</li>
  <li>Factories for the datatypes for Integer etc. to allow J#.Net to
use native .Net data types.</li>
  <li>SConnection - hasBegun() and isOpen().</li>
  <li>Way to pass extra info to drivers for queries.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>OFFSET/LIMIT added, may not be efficient in all drivers though.</li>
  <li>SEXTRA_FKEY_DDL (mainly for ON DELETE CASCADE).</li>
  <li>SFieldBytes.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Many Thanks to Bartek Muszynski for his major contribution to this
release.<br>
<h3>Version 01.12</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now compatible with J#.Net! Thanks Silvain.</li>
  <li>Added Richard Schmitds quick start reverse engineering code.</li>
  <li>New MSSQL driver (thanks Silvain).</li>
  <li>SDriver.registerDriver to add new drivers.</li>
  <li>Tweaked DB2 and SapDB drivers, thanks for contributions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 01.11</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reworked and enanced foreign key declarations for Richard,
(Payrol.UglyPayslipDetail).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 01.09</h3>
<ul>
  <li>zip file contains extra level, ie SimpleORM/simpleorm/..., thus
SimpleORM/built is undert the top folder.</li>
  <li>Greg's Optimistic Null fix.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 01.07</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed optimistic lock bug due to keys of Select()ed records not
being dirty.</li>
  <li>More vigourous optimisitic Delete locks.</li>
  <li>Update Record with References bug.</li>
  <li>Generated key Long/Int bug fixed. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 01.05</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Limit constraint names to 30 chars (oracle) 18 chars (DB2).
("_nn" now inserted to ensure uniqueness where nn is the field nr.)
Reduced example table name sizes for DB2.</li>
  <li>if (jdbcConnection.getAutoCommit()) added.</li>
  <li>Close prepared statements from SResultSet.close.</li>
  <li>Tweaked driver identification (driverName()) and added Informix.</li>
  <li>No NULL for DB2 DDL. And detachAndClose to rollback before
closing
JDBC if trans not committed. YEAR = '2001' in examples.</li>
  <li><tt>SCOLUMN_QUERY</tt> fields no longer produce DDL columns. </li>
  <li><tt>SRecordInstance.detach</tt> now nulls any undetatched
referenced records. Avoids problems during serialization. Key values
still kept. See white paper.</li>
  <li>Can mark fields <tt>SOPTIMISTIC_UNCHECKED</tt>, see white
paper. Also, only dirty fields used for optimistic locks.</li>
  <li>Can flush an optimistically locked record multiple times.</li>
  <li>Use optimistic locking by default for DBs that do not support
locking,
eg. HSQL. Make "SELECT FOR UPDATE" the default if they do -- might
break some drivers, let me know.</li>
  <li>Extra locking test case using multiple threads. If this breaks,
you have a problem that needs to be resolved. </li>
  <li>Use <tt>DATE</tt> instead of <tt>TIMESTAMP</tt> in Oracle.</li>
  <li>"Quote" identifiers in SQL to avoid reserved word issues.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 01.03</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for CHAR as well as VARCHAR.</li>
  <li>Made sure cursors closed properly.</li>
  <li>Added SResultSet.getOnlyRecord().</li>
  <li>Filled out SPreparedStatement.setLong etc. </li>
  <li>SetTimestamp etc. accept java.util.Date as well as java.sql.Date.</li>
  <li>DATETIME for MS/SQL weblogic.jdbc.mssqlserver4.Driver.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 01.01</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added SQuery class for those that wish to hide SQL queries. See
white paper and <tt>ADemo</tt> for examples. Can handle references
neatly.</li>
  <li>Optionally generates <tt>FOREIGN KEY</tt> DDL. See ADemo.java
for how this can be suppressed if necessary.</li>
  <li>Can retrieve values from several columns at once in a single
query
with <tt>SCOLUMN_QUERY</tt> (ie. Join support). Can sometimes be more
efficent, see Employee.java.</li>
  <li>SConnection extends SPropertyMap, removed connectionInfo.</li>
  <li>ColumnCacheTest tests queries of a subset of columns. Several
bugs fixed.</li>
  <li>Bound on result set sizes.</li>
  <li><tt>getString</tt> trims trailing spaces now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 00.09</h3>
Enhancements and Incompatibilities:-
<ul>
  <li>Rounded out the types with TimeStamp, Date, Time, Long, and if
all else fails the generic Object.</li>
  <li>Added a comprehensive benchmark module. Made several performance
improvements (up to 500%) SimpeleORM now rocks! See the white paper
for details.</li>
  <li><tt>validateField, validateRecord</tt> is the first of the
business rule methods implemented. Feedback most welcome, see
ADemo.</li>
  <li>Optimistic locking finished. <tt>SQY_UNLOCKED</tt> renamed to <tt>SQY_READ_ONLY</tt>
  </li>
  <li>More Record and Field properties for create
table.</li>
  <li>Added <tt>purgeAndFlush()</tt> routines to better support <tt>rawJDBCUpdates</tt></li>
  <li>Added <tt>unsafeDetach/AttachToThread</tt> for completenes.</li>
  <li><tt>SFIELD_METAS, SFIELD_INDEX</tt> properties to provide access
to meta data. Renamed <tt>SRECORD to SRECORD_META</tt>.</li>
  <li>SConnection.detatch renamed to <tt>SConnection.detachWithoutClosing</tt>,
also <tt>detatchAndClose</tt> --&gt; <tt>detachAndClose</tt>.</li>
  <li>Renamed <tt>SNOT_NULL</tt> to <tt>SMANDATORY</tt> to allow for
separation of these concepts later. Likewise <tt>isNull()</tt> changed
to <tt>isEmpty</tt> etc. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 00.08</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The properties package and sub system -- see white paper.</li>
  <li>SwingTest created -- note the way that threads are handled.</li>
  <li>Added automated key generation, Select Max or Sequences for
PostgreSQL.</li>
  <li>Improved the J2EE/EJB example.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 00.07</h3>
Added support and examples for AWT/Swing and J2EE (Weblogic).
<h3>Version 00.06</h3>
Added basic detach/attach for multi-tier applications. Also split
demos and tests -- tables created directly.
<h3>Version 00.05a</h3>
Mainly Bug fixes. Now supports MySQL as well as PostgreSQL. Slight
compatibility issue with extra param to SFieldString (need to add to
compile).
<h3>Version 00.04</h3>
White paper, and some restructuring to fit the better design including
the database drivers and deferable findOrCreate api.
<h3>Version 00.03</h3>
Added references, including identifying foreign keys.
<h3>Version 00.02</h3>
Added transaction cache and primary key based object identity. Thus
need to support an automatic update list. Can now write independent
business rules.
<h3>Version 00.01</h3>
Very basic. Generalized design no transaction cache and hence no
primary key based object identity. Explicit insert, update, delete.
Associated connections with the current thread.
<h2>Outstanding To Do List</h2>
<h3>By Next Point Version (or two)</h3>
The following list is in rough order of priority. This list also
shows which documented features are missing. Some of these tasks are
nicely independent of the core code, all help most welcome.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Alexander's bug in SDriver foo.(select...)<br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // } 21.9.2006 Alexander Banthien I think the braces
were wrong<br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // here: only prefix real columns not columnqueries
with table <br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // name. At least MSSQL had syntax errors with it.<br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (doJoin) {<br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret.append(quoteTable(tableName));<br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret.append('.');<br>
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( doJoin )
{<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret.append( quoteTable(tableName) );<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret.append( '.' );<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>SQuery.ascending(field) fails due to (non) quoting of
identifiers, inconsistent case if cols declared Lower Case.&nbsp;
General Quoting issues.</li>
  <li>public static Object rawQueryDB(String sql, String [] params, int
nrColumns) rs.close(); ps.close(); in finally blocks.<br>
  </li>
  <li>SResultSet.hasNext calls JDBC.next, but hasNext may be called
multiple times. (The Itterator semantics are wrong!) Need a magic flag.
(And actually needs to extend Iterator!)</li>
  <li>Default value for (Mandatory?) fields.</li>
  <li>Check column constraints automatically at set time.&nbsp; Not
Null, string length.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reference.&nbsp; IsNull should not query.</li>
  <li>More key generators, Key Table based,&nbsp; @@Identity.</li>
  <li>Add DISPLAY_LENGTH</li>
  <li>DataTypesTest.java -- add SDriver.SupportsTrailingSpaces etc. to
SDriver.&nbsp; For MySQL: <br>
TestUte.assertTrue(dt.getObject(DataTypes.NAME).toString().equals("Trailing&nbsp;
"));&nbsp; actually returns "Trailing"<br>
TestUte.assertEqual(""+(now2+50)/100, ""+(now+50)/100); <br>
TestUte.assertTrue(dt.getBigDecimal(DataTypes.ADECIMAL)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .equals(new
java.math.BigDecimal("123456789012345678.3333"))); "123456789012.3456"
works. MySQL 4.1 manual says that NUMERIC has the same max range as
DOUBLE.</li>
  <li>More work on SPreparedStatement.setOffset/setLimit.&nbsp; There
might be something that can be added to the underlying
ResultSet.setMaxRows.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Longer Term</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Think carefully about detaching, nulling links.&nbsp; Do we
detach parent before or after children?&nbsp; What if child.parent is
referenced during detaching process?&nbsp; etc.</li>
  <li>Think
about One end collections.&nbsp; Ie All a depts employees.&nbsp; Maybe
just as a default query?&nbsp; But detaching is key.</li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
  <li>Triming of strings/CHAR.&nbsp; Tricky to know what to do.&nbsp;
See SRecordInstance.getString for discussion.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Set Isolation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Think about Java 1.4 logging.&nbsp; Or Apache Commons.<br>
  </li>
  <li>SCofiguration object.&nbsp; (Open JDBC; for separate transaction
keys.)</li>
  <li>Some support for non-database "Transient" records.&nbsp; Ie. What
Hibernate does after new before Save.</li>
  <li>Use batchs for flushing.</li>
  <li>Database dependent ways to declare long char fields for memos
etc.
Eg. Oracle has a 2000 byte limit, MySQL &lt; 1000. A Pain, but the
drivers allow for it.
SAPDB: 8,000 max (4,000 UTF16), else Long. </li>
  <li>Maybe add MaxNrCharacters property and validate.&nbsp; (Cannot
use the parameter to SFieldString, it is typically the number of Bytes
after UTF8 compression, ie. meaningless.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>SINDEX, SUNIQUE -- Maybe create indexes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>SapDB support. Trims trailing spaces on VarCHAR. Unknown Database
'SAP DB' driver 'SAP DB'. Using generic SDriver. YEAR is a reserved
word (maybe "" all of them.)</li>
  <li>Database independent null Processing (Mandatory vs Null, Sybase
vs Oracle).</li>
  <li>Provide default values for new records (at least constants).</li>
  <li>Batch&nbsp; JDBC updates in flush.</li>
  <li>Way to include SQUERY_COLUMN field definitionss in SQuery.eq
queries.&nbsp; Also add SQuery.SubSelectEq(value,&nbsp; reference,
subquery), eg. for where Order.Product.Type = "XX".<br>
  </li>
  <li>Add table SSchema property (instead of FOO.BAR table names)</li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
  <li>Eric's extra events and business rules.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Mechanism to allow multiple errors to be thrown at once for UI
work. (R Grant)</li>
  <li>Enumerated types and Booleans. (Integration with Java 1.5?).</li>
  <li>Batch updates during Flush (JDBC 2).&nbsp; Also Lazy
findOrCreate, JDBC 2 batched queries</li>
  <li>Optimize generated keys -- retrieve in batches.</li>
  <li>Automatically join in multiple records into a single query. </li>
  <li>Different record locking modes. Eg. Serializable. Also optimistic
&amp; automatic lock promotion upon first update.</li>
  <li>Maybe some type of dependent object, eg. Address. Easy but
unclear how useful.</li>
  <li>Clear as well as Flush, ie. to be able to do large batches in one
transaction.&nbsp; Caveat: Optimistic locking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>JavaDoc</h2>
Do make the JavaDocs using <tt>ant api</tt>. The core package
includes an ER/UML diagram which shows all the classes of SimpleORM
together with the relationships between them and the more important
methods. It should prove useful when working through the examples.<br>
