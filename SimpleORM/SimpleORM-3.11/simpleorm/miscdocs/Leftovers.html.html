<h2>Hibernate</h2>
We
often compare SimpleORM to Hibernate because Hibernate has become the
most widely used ORM. &nbsp;Unlike other early open source ORMs it
takes database semantics and locking seriously. &nbsp;It is very
complex, and described in the book "Java Persistence with Hibernate" by
Bauer &amp; King which contains over 800 pages of dense text.
&nbsp;(Compared to the few pages required to document SimpleORM.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Hibernate <br>
It is full featured,&nbsp;<br>
(Hibernate is
over 2400K plus about 2000K of dependent Jars.)<br>
<br>
Given<br>
@Entity<br>
public class Event {&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @Id @GeneratedValue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long id;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @Column<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String
title;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @OneToMany(mappedBy="event",
fetch=FetchType.LAZY) // Lazy reccommened pp JPWH p570<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set&lt;Activity&gt;
activities = new
HashSet();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Event getThis() {return
this;}<br>
}<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
@Entity<br>
public class Activity {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @Id @GeneratedValue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long id;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event event;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @Column<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String name;&nbsp; <br>
}<br>
<br>
Then <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event event2bPre =
(Event)session.get(Event.class, 2L);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity act4bPre =
(Activity)session.get(Activity.class, 4L);&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assertEqual("Second Event",
act4bPre.event.title);<br>
Works.<br>
<br>
But <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity act4b =
(Activity)session.get(Activity.class, 4L);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
assertTrue(act4b.event.getClass().getName().contains("Event$$EnhancerByCGLIB"));
// Ahh!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event event2aPost =
(Event)session.get(Event.class, 2L);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assertTrue(null ==
act4b.event.title);<br>
Does not work -- act4b.event.title should not be null.<br>
<br>
I think that the weird proxy class is to blame.&nbsp; I have
sometimes even got Entity.getThis() != this(!).<br>
<br>
The
definitions for the classes are as recommended by the book,
AFAIK.&nbsp; I suspect that the annotations are not properly
supported/documented, and have weird JPA issues, and so I would
probably be better off sticking to XML.&nbsp; (Have not tried.)<br>
<br>
But I have spent several hours on this trivial example.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Needless complexity is evil.<br><br><h3>&nbsp;

"The reader may very well criticize me at this point that this is
simply a bug in Hibernate, and I shouldn&#8217;t harp on it - all products
have bugs, including SQL Anywhere. I agree. My point, however, is that <strong>transactional
semantics are very difficult to get right</strong>, and the
complexities offered by Hibernate, particularly with Hibernate&#8217;s
implementation of caching to &#8220;solve&#8221; performance problems, can easily
lead an application developer down a garden path, only to discover
correctness issues after it is too late."&nbsp;
<br><br><br> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/09/13/dont-let-hibernate-steal-your-identity.html">http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/09/13/dont-let-hibernate-steal-your-identity.html.</a><br><h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId627792"></a>Performance
and
Benchmarks</h2>
Last but by no means least it is very important that an ORM not add
any significant overheads to an application that is running in an
enterprise application. To check that that is the case a careful
series of benchmarks have been constructed.
<p>The tests are based on the classic Department/Employee schema.
Rows
are inserted, queried and updated, both sequentially and randomly. The
results are for PostgreSQL. (It would be interesting to see how they
compare with other datbases but care is required, eg. HSQL has
checkpointing overhead.) </p>
<p>The tests were done on a single PC with no network overheads.
Each
test is run in its own single transaction. All the benchmarks
actually do something, eg. calculate a total salary and budget, so
that one can have confidence that they are all actually working
correctly.</p>
<p>The tests and times are are as follows. All times are quoted
in
terms
of the number of milliseconds per iteration, with at least 1,000
iterations depending on the test. (The times vary about 10% between
runs due to database buffer state etc.)</p>
<p>

</table>
</p>
<p>The first result is that SimpleORM adds no measurable overhead
to
using raw JDBC. The queries for the Insert and QuerySequential were
very similar, and so were the results. The over head for building the
<tt>SRecordInstant</tt> structure and adding it to the
cache was a
negligable 0.1 milliseconds/record.</p>
<p>The cache then made SimpleORM over 3.0 milliseconds per record
<em>faster</em> than JDBC on the QueryRandom and
UpdateRandom trials
because the cache minimized expensive database hits. If a network had
been used the reduction in database hits would have produced even more
dramatic improvements. SimpleORM is also faster for repeated field
access, which is significant because there are typically many fields
per record.</p>
<p>The bulk update test updates many rows with one SQL statement.
The
times are the same because they are the same SQL statement. But note
that
this is an order of magnitude faster than using individual update
statements for each row, even without the network overhead. Thus it
is important that an ORM allow the buffer to be flushed and purged so
that this can be done safely.</p>
&lt;&gt;But probably the biggest performance issue is not
tested by the
benchmark, namely transaction management. JDBC programmers on large
systems tend to loose track of the connection object across modules,
and so create far too many transactions. EJB users often use CMT,
which also tends to produce far too many transactions (eg. the
Weblogic demos). By associating the connection with the current
thread, but still giving explicit control over transactions, SimpleORM
encourages transaction structures that are efficient and correct.
This performance consideration can dwarf all others<br><br>








<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId374725"></a>Future Work</h2>







<p>The following features are ideas for future development of either
SimpleORM itslef or of companion modules to SimpleORM. Again, the
generalized design makes this easy to do. Further ideas are welcome.</p>







<ul>
<li>Basic UI module that utilizes meta properties.</li><li>Enumerations.</li><li>Automated mechanisms to pass packets of related data to a client.</li><li>JDBC 2 delayed queries and batching. Join optimization.</li><li>Advanced sub-type (vs sub-class) mechanism.</li><li>More complex mappings, in particular to be able to pack tightly
coupled objects into blobs, eg. list of points.</li><li>Tighter integration with specific Databases, JDBC drives and App
Servers. Look at driver dependent ways to detect transactions that are
committed outside of SimpleOrm.</li><li>Close integration with an Entity-Relational style modeling tool.</li>
</ul>







<p>[Note that the following Read Mostly cache has not been
implemented.]
</p>








<p>The Read Mostly cache is a separate cache to the Transaction Cache.
Unlike the Transaction Cache, it is shared between different threads
and spans transactions. It can therefore be very efficient because it
can substantially reduce the number of times a record needs to be
retrieved from the database. But it also does not reliably reflect the
current state of the database. Read Mostly records are only updated
when they time out or when another transaction in the same JVM happens
to commit a change to the record. And Read Mostly records have limited
query options.
</p>








<p>Thus the Read Mostly cache can be used to efficiently retrieve each
Employee's Department's Name which rarely changes and can be a few
hours out of date without problems. But it must not be used to
retrieve the current status of the Employee's time sheet. The Read
Mostly cache is not used by default, but can be put to good use for
specific applications. It provides 80% of the benefit of a fully
updatable cache which would need complex distributed locking and
querying for about 10% of the effort.</p>







<h2>Enumerations</h2>
<p>Enumerated types can be implemented as a user defined field
type as illustrated in the following fragment. <tt>SEnum</tt> is
a fairly ordinary implementation of poor man's enums that also
extends <tt>SFieldMeta</tt> (it also handles serialization and
internationalization issues). </p>









<pre>class EmployeeType extends SEnum {<br>  static final EeType FULL_TIME = new EmployeeType("FULL_TIME"); <br>  static final EeType PART_TIME = new EmployeeType("PART_TIME"); <br>  static final EeType CONTRACTOR = new EmployeeType("CONTRACTOR");<br>}<br>...<br>class Employee extends SRecordMeta { ...<br>  static final EmployeeType EE_TYPE  = new EmployeeType(meta, "EE_TYPE");<br>...<br>}<br>...<br>EmployeeType eeType = (EmployeeType)employee.getObject(Employee.EE_TYPE);<br>EmployeeType eeType = Employee.EE_TYPE.getValue(employee); // Alternative.<br>...<br>if (!EmployeeType.isValid(locale, usersInput))...</pre>









<p>Note that this is <i>all</i> the code that is required to
implement and validate enumerations -- no need to write your own
getters and setters that convert between database strings and
enum objects. </p>









<p>There are other similar declarative validations
such as checking a string matches a pattern or in the example
below that a field is bounded.</p>









<pre>class Employee extends SRecordMeta { ...<br>  static final SFieldMeta SALARY  = new RangedDouble(meta, 0, 200000);</pre>









<p><tt>SFieldBoolean</tt> is a special case of <tt>SEnum</tt>. It may
be mapped directly to a boolean type for databases that support that
(eg. Postgres) or to String or Integer types.
<a name="rules"></a></p>









<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId719249"></a></h2>
<br>
<h2>Java Data Objects (JDO)</h2>







<p>[Not implemented as of Version 1.0. But easy, just has not been
requested.]
</p>







<p>SimpeORM is usually used with the generalized
<tt>SRecordInstance</tt>s as shown in the rest of this paper. But it
is also possible to store record state in conventional,
non-generalized Java objects that are managed outside of SimpleORM.
</p>







<p>This can be useful for persisting objects created outside the
current application. For example one might have an existing personnel
system to which you want to add persistence. This is rare in practice
because persistence is a fundamental issue, not something that can be
tacked on. In our example, a personnel system without persistence
would be useless. However, SimpleORM can support this approach when
needed.
</p>







<p>The next fragment shows how to code JDO access in SimpleORM. Each
<tt>SRecordInstance</tt> contains a pointer to the JDO object. This
allows key based identity to be maintained. There are then several
options to synchronize values.
</p>







<pre> SConnection.begin() Employee employee<br>=&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>(Employee)Employee.meta.findOrCreate("123-45-6789");<br>if&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>(employee.getJDO() == null) // must be true after<br>begin()&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>employee.setJDO( new ExternalEmployee(p1, p2...)); ExternalEmployee<br><br>xe&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>= employee.getJDO(); xe.salary=1234; ... Employee employee2<br>=&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>(Employee)Employee.meta.findOrCreate("123-45-6789");<br>if&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>(employee.getJDO() == null)... // is now false, do<br>nothing.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>ExternalEmployee xe2 = employee.getJDO(); assert(xe ==<br>xe2);&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br></pre>







<p><tt>getJDO</tt> is null the first time that "<tt>123-45-678</tt>"
is accessed in the transaction regardless of whether the record
already exists in the database. The application can then create an
object specifying arbitrary initialization parameters. Alternatively
it may retrieve the <tt>ExternalEmployee</tt> from a hash map.
</p>







<p>Thus SimpleORM gives total flexibility about its JDO life cycle
(unlike Sun's JDO). SimpleORM will guarantee that there is only one
JDO object for each SimpleORM record, but it is the application's
responsibility to ensure that there is only one SimpleORM record for
each JDO object. (The latter can never be a problem if the JDO
records are created rather than looked up.)
</p>







<p>Data values can be manually moved between the record and the JDO
giving complete flexibility. SimpleORM also provides methods
<tt>get|setJDOFields|Methods</tt> that reflect into the JDO object and
automatically get or set the field values, either directly or via
get/set methods. (References are not copied.)
</p>







<p>Calls to these methods may be included within the business rule
framework. In particular, <tt>setJDOFields|Methods</tt> can be called
from the <tt>postQuery</tt> event method, and
<tt>getJDOFields|Methods</tt> can be called in placed in the
<tt>synchronizeRecord</tt> event method. This will ensure that JDO
object are synchronized with the database.
</p>







<p>The SimpleORM JDO approach is as safe as possible without resorting
to byte code post processing or other nasty tricks. However,
SimpleORM cannot provide the same degree of control as provided for
<tt>SRecordInstance</tt>s. For example, there is no way to detect
attempts to access unqueried fields, and it is not possible to
automatically lazily follow references. Objects can be shared between
transactions, with potentially disasterous results. Thus the JDO
approach should only be used where there is existing code that uses
existing Java objects, and it is meaningful to add persistence to
them.
<a name="process"></a></p>
<br>

<a name="resultsets"></a>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId355"></a>Result Sets and Relationships</h2>







<p>SimpleORM allows fields to be specified using arbitrary SQL
expressions, which may include subselects. For example
</p>







<pre>public class Employee extends SRecordInstance { ... <br>  static final SFieldString DEPT_NAME = new SFieldString(<br>    meta, "DEPT_NAME", 1000, SFD_UNQUERIED, <br>    SCOLUMN_QUERY.pvalue( "(SELECT NAME FROM XX_DEPARTMENT D<br>      WHERE D.DEPT_ID = XX_EMPLOYEE.DEPT_ID)"));<br></pre>







<p>The <tt>SCOLUMN_QUERY</tt> text is simply included in the query.
This can be faster than issuing two queries, and makes the Departement
Name easily accessible.
</p>







<p>[Note that the following techniques in this section have not been
implemented as at version 1.0. However the API has been designed with
this in mind, so it should be fairly easy to add later.]
</p>







<p>However, the SimpleORM API has been carefully designed to provide
more direct and automatic optimizations. In particular, the user does
not normally control when database queries are actually performed.
This enables SimpleORM to combine multiple queries into a single JDBC
2 batch which can substantially reduce network traffic. In the
example below, the first <tt>findOrCreate()</tt> always returns an
Employee record regardless of whether it exists on the database. Thus
both the queries can be deferred until <tt>emp1</tt>'s Name is
accessed, and so combined into one batch. (We are not aware of any
other O/R system that allows this.)
</p>







<pre>  emp1 = Employee.meta.findOrCreate("FIRST");<br>  emp2 = Employee.meta.findOrCreate("SECOND");<br>  name1 = emp1.getString(Employee.NAME); // Both queries can be done here.<br></pre>







<p>Likewise, in the following fragment the retrieval of the Department
record could be delayed until the last moment (if the JDBC driver
supports batches). In particular, the department's key fields can be
referenced without causing a query to be issued. (There is also a
facility to explicilty denormalize the Department's Name.)
</p>







<pre>   emp1 = Employee.meta.findOrCreate("FIRST");<br>   Department dept = <br>      (Department)employee.getReference(employee.DEPARTMENT);<br>   ... dept.getString(dept.DEPT_ID); // No query, primary key<br>   ... dept.getString(dept.NAME); // Query only performed now.<br></pre>







<p>Normally the Department is retrieved lazily as a separate query.
But if it is known that an Employee's Department info will be needed
then it is also possible to retrieve the Departement as part of the
same query as the Employee. If Department reference is
mandatory (declared NOT NULL) then an inner join may be used,
otherwise only an outer join or subselect must be used, depending what
is supported by the database.
</p>







<p>(This optimization is not always optimal. If there a large
number of Employees per Department then it would be better to just
retrieve each Department information once using separate queries and
key based identity rather than retrieving the same information for
each Employee. Or possibly use one query to retrieve all Departments
up front, or or just those Departments containing the Employees you
are interested in.)
</p>







<p>Note that this join optimization can be achieved without needing to
artificially create an object that contains both Employee and
Department information. It is purely a query optimization that does
not affect the application structure. SimpleORM encourages direect
mappings between objects in memory and
tables in the database. If the relational schema design does not
closely reflects the structure of the applications data it should be
corrected!</p>







<p>In practice complex mappings have limited use. When the
subtleties of persistence such as information quality and record
locking are taken into consideration, their true semantics become
very difficult to define. (One thing that is useful is packaging up
large numbers of small memory resident objects into a single
relational column. This is future work.)</p>







<p>The <tt>SResultSet</tt> cursor is normally only used for reading
data in a very simple way. &nbsp;Semi-standard JDBC 2.0 features are
not made available to the user (although they may be used internally
at flush time). Thus Inserts, Updates and Deletes are performed
using individual DML statements.&nbsp; This means that their
visibility from an open cursor is not well defined. &nbsp;Further, one
can only read forward through the cursor. &nbsp;In the unlikely event
that this behaviour is important to an application, then manual JDBC
should be used directly to manipulate the relevant table, and in any
case the behaviour will probably vary between different database
products.</p>







<p>(It is also possible to use the <tt>doUpdate</tt> event to provide
an explicit query or to call an database procedure instead of having
SimpleORM generate the queries.)<br>
</p>
<h2>Generator</h2>
<br>
<p>This means that once the Record classes have been written, business
rules can be added and then the rest of the application developed in
the normal manenr. There are no XML files to maintain. No special
techniques are required.
</p>









<p>However, if you have a different source of truth such as an XML
file then you have two choices, namely to generate the SimpleORM files
or to interpret the XML at run time.
</p>









<p>If you generate the SimpleORM classes then be sure to create a
super class of the record, not the record itself. Eg.
</p>









<pre> /** WARNING -- GENERATED CODE -- DO NOT EDIT */<br>class&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>EmployeeGenerated extends SRecordInstance { private static<br><br>final&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>SRecordMeta meta = new SRecordMeta(Employee.class, "XX_EMPLOYEE");<br><br>}&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br></pre>









<p>then you can manually write
</p>









<pre> /** Not generated code, edit freely. */ class Employee<br><br>extends&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>EmployeeGenerated { // Extra business rules and property defintions<br><br>go&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br>here }&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br></pre>









<p>Be sure to place any generated code in a built directory and NOT
the main source directory. You may need to change build.xml.
</p>









<p>There is also no need to declare all fields in advance as
constants. New <tt>SFieldMeta</tt> objects may be created at at
run time that can be used to reference columns that were not known at
compile time. Thus the XML files can simply be interpreted at
run time. The class parameter to the <tt>SRecordMeta</tt>
initializer is just the object type that is returned by
<tt>findOrCreate</tt> and friends. It could just be be
<tt>SRecordInstance.class</tt>. You would then access fields using
</p>









<pre> String phone =<br><br>employee.getString(employee.getField("PHONE_NR"));&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;<br><br></pre>









<p>(The string is necessary because you do not have the constants
available.)
</p>









<p>Interpretation rather than generation has the advantage of keeping
the build process simple and avoiding the need to write a generator.
More importantly it means that one can can allow end users to add
extra columns to application tables, and the application can still
display and manipulate these extra columns. JDBC's meta data can be
used to make this fairly seamless. However, there will be some
overhead in loading all the XML every time you run the program.
</p>









<p>There will also be a simple boot strap utility to create a default
record definition from an existing table using JDBC meta data. This
is normally used as a once off tool to generate a class that is then
modified. However, it is also possible to generate a dummy class
which is speciallised with a subclass that augments the definitions
and adds business rules. [Outstanding.]
</p>
