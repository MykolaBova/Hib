  The SimpleORM JDBC Interface which moves data between a JDBC accessed database and an SDataSet.<p>
        
This package is dependent on the dataset package which are used to store the data and meta data.  
It is built in a second step to the dataset package to ensure that there are no dependencies from the dataset package to this one.<p>

This is packaged into simpleorm-sessionJdbc.jar.jar<p>
    
 See the <a href="../../../../webSite/sorm/whitepaper.html">../../../../webSite/sorm/whitepaper.html</a> for a
 more details.<p>

The website is <a href="http://www.simpleorm.org">www.SimpleORM.org</a> which contains current information.  (A local copy is at <a href="../../../../webSite/index.html">../../../../webSite/index.html</a>).<p>

Note that most non public declarations have package scope, not private
scope.  This includes instance variables.  Further, the simpleorm jar
is not sealed.  This means that if you do need to hack SimpleORM you
can generally create a new class within the simpleorm.core package
with appropriate static methods, and thus not need to change the
SimpleORM classes themselves.  Of course this is not supported, and
make sure you let us know what you did so that we can incorporate the
changes into the main package.<p>
