SimpleORM provides a simple, convenient yet powerful way to map
objects in memory to tables in a relational database.<p>

See the <a href="../../webSite/sorm/whitepaper.html">../../webSite/sorm/whitepaper.html</a> for a
detailed description of what SimpleORM does and why it is good.</p><p>

<a href="../../webSite/sorm/README.html">../../webSite/sorm/README.html</a> describes how to build
SimpleORM and contains information about the current release.</p><p>

And see examples/ADemo.java for an example of common usage.

The website is <a href="http://www.simpleorm.org">www.SimpleORM.org</a> which 
contains current information.  (A local copy is at <a href="../../webSite/index.html">../../webSite/index.html</a>).</p><p>

The code is built by ant, the default task compiles and runs SimpleOrm with the provided Hsqldb database.</p><p>

Note that most non public declarations have package scope, not private
scope.  This includes instance variables.  Further, the simpleorm jar
is not sealed.  This means that if you do need to hack SimpleORM you
can generally create a new class within the simpleorm.core package
with appropriate static methods, and thus not need to change the
SimpleORM classes themselves.  Of course this is not supported, and
make sure you let us know what you did so that we can incorporate the
changes into the main package.</p><p>
